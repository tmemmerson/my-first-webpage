                <td>Earth is where I live. Being that I live here, it's clearly one of my favorites! It's where I call home.</td>
                <td>I love mercury because despite being the closest to the sun, it is not the hottest planet.</td>
                <td>I love Mars because it has Olympus Mons, a mountain 3x larger than Mount Everest!</td>
                <td>I love traveling to Saturn because the rings are made of particles as small as pennies, to as large as mountains!</td>

            <td>Venus is approximately the same size as earth, but a single day on Venus equals a full earth-year.</td>
            <td>Uranus is fun and unique becaause it's the planet furthest off its axis. The planet looks tilted!</td>
            <td>You <em>HAVE</em> to visit Jupiter at least once. If only because it's the largest planet!</td>
            <td>Neptune is great, but watch out for the planets continual storms and even hurricanes.</td>
